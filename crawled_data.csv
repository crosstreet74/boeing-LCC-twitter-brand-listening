2019-05-19`Airline industry is rough: fierce competition, many (online) complaints, security concerns, &amp;, most recently, technology issues (737 Max). @Delta doesn't have last one, but has all others issues. #airlines #business #industry #CustomerService @united @AmericanAir @Boeing #travel
2019-05-16`@IBDinvestors Please correct your article stating “.... airlines like Southwest, American, United and Alaska Air Group's (ALK) Alaska Airlines use the 737 Max”. Alaska Airliens does NOT use the Max. They have orders but no one flying.

2019-05-14`@NPR @AP @UPI @Reuters @cspanradio @business @tictoc @FT @WSJ @cnnbrk @MSNBC @FoxNews @USATODAY I will never fly Southwest, American, or United Airlines while the Boeing 737 Max is part of their fleet of planes. There are too many safe options, and I'll never trust Boeing again. 
2019-05-14`United Airlines is jazzing up its in-flight safety video by bringing in Spider-Man. But is it too soon for fun after the 737 Max grounding? 
2019-05-14`Interesting line: United has said it learned after the March 10 Ethiopian Airlines crash that 737 Max cockpit warnings weren't working properly. Southwest learned after October Lion Air crash. Boeing's conflicting messaging to its own customers isn't getting enough attention

2019-04-03`Grounding the Boeing 737 Max was a no-brainer. Trump’s corporatocracy stood in the way. - “After the crash of one of its Max 8 airliners, Ethiopian Airlines opted to send the doomed plane’s black boxes not to the United States but to Europe.” 
2019-04-03`On the Boeing 737 MAX there were optional safety features to buy, and which might have prevented the crashes. Can point fingers at Boeing/FAA, but some airlines chose to buy them and others didn’t. @SouthwestAir did; @united didn’t. Seems to match my impression of the airlines...

2019-03-27`Are we to believe that airlines in the United States didn't purchase the optional safety features, either? Or is the Boeing 737 MAX perhaps less safe than the company wants everyone to believe? The plane's faults are very clearly a global issue.

2019-03-23`Dafuq?!? I’d rather take a 737 max air flight on another airline
2019-03-22`This question is clearly very important to United Airlines. Be careful how you identify. The wrong answer could have you dragged off an overbooked plane or reassigned to an economy class aisle seat on a Boeing 737 Max 8. 
2019-03-22`Brought to you by the airline that opted not to buy safety features on the 737 Max. #UnitedAirlines

2019-03-21`United Airlines didn’t spring for the angle of attack indicator nor the disagree light on the 737 Max? … yeah, that’s about what I would expect from United. 
2019-03-21`I just read this article. I was happy to see that American, and United Airlines had this option already on the 737 max.
2019-03-21`United Airlines, which ordered 137 (737 MAX) planes and has received 14, did not select the (angle of attack) indicators or the disagree light. You are now on my no-fly list.
2019-03-21`Well you guys can argue but I assure you that safety is every airlines top priority &amp; nobody want to operate unsafe equipment. The 737 max will not return to service until it is 100% certain that all systems are safe &amp; any extra training is complete
2019-03-21`above the pilots’ heads. After the Lion Air crash, Southwest said it would modify its 737 Max fleet to place the angle of attack indicator on the pilots’ main computer screens. United Airlines, which ordered 137 of the planes and has received 14, did not select the indicators or

2019-03-21`...Of the US airlines who have purchased the 737 max series aircraft
2019-03-21`United Airlines didn’t opt for either safety feature on 737 Max. Makes you wonder what else they opted out of to save $$@united 
2019-03-21`From NYT- United Airlines, which ordered 137 737-MAX planes and has received 14, did not select the [optional safety] indicators or the disagree light. #unitedairlines
2019-03-21`Delta is lucky not to have Boeing 737 Max. Whoever went cheap and didn’t buy enough safety feature are going to lose the faith of passengers, especially when their reputation is already in question such as United Airlines. Hope Delta changes company philosophy soon to survive!
2019-03-21`And 2 of the 3 carriers flying the 737 Max went with at least the disagree indicator. United didn't but I'd bet handsomely they have some other custom system. The airline industry doesn't sell safety as a matter of practice but in the US it's a thing.

2019-03-12`@united @AmericanAir as a frequent flier with you I am afraid I’ll go out of my way to fly with an airline that does not fly the 737 max 8. Out of an abundance of caution you need to ground these planes until the investigations are completed.

2019-03-12`Agreed. But they don’t want to take the short-term loss (I think United also has 737 Max 8s in its fleet). Airline execs are basically crossings their fingers and hoping for the best.

2019-03-12`So the entire world is grounding the new Boeing 737 Max 8 &amp; Max 9 airplanes, after the Ethiopian Airlines tragedy — except for the United States... Could it have anything to do with the fact that our Acting Secretary of Defense was a Boeing executive before Trump hired him? 
2019-03-12`Australia (CASA) has banned the Boeing 737 MAX 8 entering Australia airspace....I think it affects only Fiji Airlines.....

2019-03-12`The fact that United Airlines, &amp; Southwest are going to continue to use the model 737 Max 8 that has crashed twice in the last 5 months is ridiculous to me.

2019-03-12`The fact that those two airlines are responsible for properly training their crews is not enough to convince me that the United States should not investigate the accidents and examine the 737 Max planes, including grounding them until passenger safety can be reasonably assured.

2019-03-11`Three ways to know if you're booked on a 737 MAX 8: 1. Click on the flight number in your airline website or app. 2. Plug the registration number on the outside of your plane into the FAA database. 3. Use an Aviation app such as FlightRadar24.
2019-03-11`So far, no airlines in the United States have grounded 737 Max 8s.  via @AFARMedia

2019-03-11`US airlines including United, Southwest, and American continue to fly the Boeing 737 Max 8 in the wake of this weekend’s deadly crash in Africa. Does the crash make you hesitant to fly?
2019-03-11`United Airlines flies a different version of the 737 MAX -- the 737 MAX 9. It currently has 14 in its fleet. Although there are no reports that MAX 9s have had any trouble with their AOA sensors, the FAA included that type of plane in its November emergency directive.
2019-03-11`Time to retire these things @AOL @SouthWest @United! These US airlines operate Boeing 737 Max jets - Fox Business 
2019-03-11`C'mon @AmericanAir @SouthwestAir @united Ground your fleets of the Boeing 737 MAX. China, Indonesia, Ethiopian Airlines, Caymen Airways have. There is good reason for an investigation by @BoeingAirplanes @NTSB @FAANews Is passenger safety less important than the almighty dollar?
2019-03-11`Are you @SouthwestAir INSANE? Boeing 737 Max 8s continue to crash &amp; kill hundreds but all you care about are dollars?! As a Rapid Rewards member, I will no longer fly with you until you GROUND these planes as other airlines have done. I will fly @United! @HoustonChron, thoughts?
2019-03-11`Until @Boeing answers honestly about 737 Max 8 airplane issues, anyone flying on one is at risk. Southwest Airlines (LUV) has the largest fleet of 737 MAX airplanes; RyanAir (RYAAY); FlyDubai, according to Boeing. American Airlines (AAL) and United (UAL) also fly the MAX.
2019-03-11`The Boeing 737 Max plane, which has been involved in 2 deadly crashes in 5 months, is used by American Airlines, Southwest, and United. Here’s how to find out if you’re flying on one. 
2019-03-11`US airlines rely on @Boeing 737 Max aircraft to get you across the country. @SouthwestAir flies 34. @AmericanAir flies 24 @united flies 14. Is anyone nervous being a passenger on one today? Insight from an American pilot: 
2019-03-11`Meanwhile, in the United States, airlines including American Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and United Airlines gave no indication they would temporarily halt operating the 737 Max. 
2019-03-11`apparently the only two united states based airlines that will still be flying the boeing 737 max-8 are american airlines &amp; southwest. we’re taking american airlines home as if my anxiety about flying wasn’t already through the roof.
2019-03-11`Interesting coincidence that the best airlines in today’s market (@JetBlue, @Delta and @AlaskaAir) are NOT using Boeing 737 Max 8? In comparison to @SouthwestAir, @AmericanAir and @united are STILL using them I rather pay more (even double) to be safe!
2019-03-11`I must confess that I am so phobic of flying that I confirmed with United that I am not on a Boeing 737 MAX 8 to get to AWP. United tells me they have no MAX 8. But American Airlines has 24 of these planes &amp; Southwest has 34—and they are still flying them. 
2019-03-11`“Southwest Airlines (LUV) has the largest fleet of 737 MAX 8 airplanes, followed by RyanAir (RYAAY) and FlyDubai, according to Boeing. American Airlines (AAL) and United (UAL) also fly the MAX 8. Delta (DAL) does not fly any 737 MAX variants.”
2019-03-11`@MoCA_GoI you must ground all Boeing 737 MAX aircraft that are flying in India. Following the dreadful Ethiopian airlines crash, US media are reporting that a United Airlines flight with the same plane had engine trouble. Ground these planes.
2019-03-11`737-900 United engine explosion and fire Lion Air 737-Max Crash :'( Ethiopian 737-Max Crash :'( Southwest Airlines 737 Engine Failure/haul rupture Seriously, not getting on any Boing 737s anytime soon.
2019-03-11`French news channel BFM TV posted the #of 737 Max craft by airline &amp; region. If accurate, United has 16. 
2019-03-11`737 max model is used by American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines. So I’d double check what type of plane is being used on my next flight.
2019-03-11`US flyers still flying this doomed aircraft! Which #airlines are still flying #Boeing 737 MAX 8s? #Delta #United #SouthwestAirlines ?
2019-03-11`Shoutout to @delta &amp; @JetBlue for having NO BOEING 737 max planes. Two of my favorite airlines always seem ahead &amp; the United States should follow suit with the grounding of all Boeing 737 max planes.
2019-03-11`China and Indonesia have grounded all 737 Max 8 flights. Yet, here in the United States airlines such as Southwest and United continue to fly the same model....

2019-03-11`My deepest condolences to families of the deceased travelling in the Ethiopian Airlines. I wonder if Southwest, and United Airlines are going to ground all their Boeing 737 Max, the same model aeroplane that crashed, as China, and Indonesia did. #EthiopianAirlinesCrash
2019-03-11`United,Southwest, and American Airlines need to cancel all Boeing 737 Max 8 Until they can find out what is going on this is the second Crash in 5 Months 2 Systems one up and one down and it confuses the men and women steering the plane make them think it is taking a nose dive
2019-03-11`@united @SouthwestAir boeing 737 max 8 crashed March 10, why have the airlines in U.S not grounded this plane following two fatal crashes in less than 6 months. China leads on this? @HouseDemocrats @SenateDems
2019-03-11`Airlines in other countries have grounded their Boeing 737 MAX 8 jets after the Ethiopian Airlines crash. The planes are flown by American, Southwest &amp; United in the U.S. 
2019-03-11`I believe all United States based airlines should ground the @BoeingAirplanes 737 Max 8 &amp; @Boeing should spearhead the grounding, inspect all planes, and figure out what’s going on! #Ground737Max8

2019-03-11`All I know is that all those 737 Max planes should be grounded until its unquestionably safe. @SouthwestAir @united and every other airline flying. China is having more common sense about this than the #FAA
2019-03-11`@United If you do not take seriously grounding all 737-Max models until this can be completely investigated, I may have to switch airlines and my upcoming flights with you!!
2019-03-11`@Delta @AmericanAir @united @SouthwestAir are you flying any of these planes in the US? @FAANews Boeing postpone new aircraft launch as airlines respond to fears over the company’s 737 MAX 8 planes 
2019-03-11`Yes Southwest, American, United All fly the #Boeing737Max8 jets a total of 40 Airlines fly the Boeing 737 MAX Around the World 
2019-03-11`Two brand new Boeing 737 Max 8 airplanes crashed in 5 months. If China has grounded all 96 of its 737 Max 8s, then Southwest, American, and United Airlines should really do something to reassure the American people that its 737 Max 8 airplanes are airworthy or ground them too.
2019-03-11`We are deeply saddened by the tragedy involving our Star Alliance partner, Ethiopian Airlines and offer our deepest sympathies to all those affected. The crash involved a Boeing 737 Max 8. United doesn't fly the Boeing 737 Max 8. ^AN

2019-03-11`This is the exact article that was published after the Lion Air Flight 610 crash in Indonesia before today’s absolutely heartbreaking tragedy with Ethiopian Airlines. So people knew about this issue. And Southwest Airlines, American Airlines, and United use the Boeing 737 Max 8.
2019-03-11`@united I am flying your airline on a 737-800 between Newark &amp; PDX. Is that a MAX plane? Do you currently fly any 737 MAX planes? If so, will you be grounding them due to the safety risk?

2019-03-10`American, Southwest, Canada, and United, and countless others have been operating the 737 MAX aircraft for three years and there has never been an incident. The two airlines to have problems are notorious for having pilots with low hours and shotty maintenance records.
